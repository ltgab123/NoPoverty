    <h2>OUR PROCESS OF FINALISING
        THE PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Firstly we all took interviews of some people and then took out the common as well as the different opinions of the people.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Then we all made an individual problem statement and after a little bit of discussion we concluded the ideas and came to the final problem statement.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Although “No Poverty” is a very popular topic. Still people do not know about it. As a result, people do not know the steps taken by the government. Moreover, we want to change people’s mindset about poverty and make sure that they do not take it lightly.
