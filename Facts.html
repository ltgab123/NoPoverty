        <h1>Facts About The Target 1.2</h1>
        
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Target 1.2 of SDG 1 aims to halve, by 2030, the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions. This target emphasizes the need to address various dimensions of poverty, including income poverty, lack of access to basic resources and services, and social exclusion. By focusing on these dimensions, the goal is to ensure a comprehensive approach to poverty reduction that goes beyond just income measures. Achieving this target requires coordinated efforts at national and international levels to implement policies and programs that uplift the vulnerable and marginalized populations, fostering inclusive economic growth and social well-being.</p>
